This is a script to create servers on Hetzner Cloud. You need to have your Hetzner API key downloaded to a file ~/.hetzner_api. There aren't any other dependencies except curl which should be almost everywhere. 

A couple of changes that I plan to make:

- check the API key at the beginning
- do some functional refactoring
- add cloud init
